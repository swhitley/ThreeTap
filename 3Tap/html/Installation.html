    <p>Once you click the <i>link</i>, the setup file will be downloaded.
    Your browser will warn you that this is an unsafe file. Because you trust me :), you can ignore the browser warning
    and continue opening the file.</p>

    In the Chrome browser, you will see the following warning
    that you can override by clicking the down arrow and <i>keep</i>.
